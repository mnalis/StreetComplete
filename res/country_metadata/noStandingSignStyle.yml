# Style of "no standing" sign.
#
# Styles:
# - mutcd text standing - rectangular with text "NO STANDING"
# - mutcd text waiting - rectangular with text "NO WAITING"
#
# In reality, each sign in each country looks slightly different, hence this is just a grouping by
# general style.
# See the files in https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/tree/master/res/graphics/street%20parking/no%20standing%20sign
# for a generalized visualization of each. (those are (c) Tobias Zwick, Licence: CC-BY-SA 4.0)
