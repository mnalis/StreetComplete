# Style of the road markings that indicate that it is prohibited to stand here. No default - if
# not specified, there do not exist dedicated lane markings for "no standing".
#
# unless stated otherwise, the lines are continuous, usually at a small
# distance to the curb and either ending in a short line to the curb
# like this └────┘ or like this ├────┤ (no differentiation is made in this list)
# to indicate the start/end.

# "White on curb" is actually a passenger loading zone, which requires a more detailed
# tagging (parking:condition:reason=passenger_loading_zone). Mappers in California prefer that
# this option is not displayed at all as long as there is not explicit support to project that,
# i.e. this would go into a file named passengerLoadingZoneLineStyle.yml
