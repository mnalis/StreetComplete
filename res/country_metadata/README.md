Files in this directory are also used to generate per-country files in `app/src/main/assets/country_metadata/`

Where are all the other files? They have been moved to a separate repository: https://github.com/streetcomplete/countrymetadata/

You can use `./gradlew generateMetadataByCountry` while in the root StreetComplete folder to rerun this generation.
