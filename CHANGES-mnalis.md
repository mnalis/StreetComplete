## Changes in mnalis branch

This file details changes made in https://github.com/mnalis/StreetComplete/tree/mnalis
as modified from upstream https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete

* automatic gihub build Actions
  to get artifact .apk, so we don't need local android build environment
* update email/github links to this repository
  so upstream is not bothered with bugs introduced here
* show ALL notes
  when `Show all notes` in preferences is enabled, really **show ALL notes**,
  including your own (only hide notes that user explicitely asked to hide,
  and which can be unhidden via `Restore hidden quests` preference)

## TODO
