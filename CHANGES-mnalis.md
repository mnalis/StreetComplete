## Changes in mnalis-v37-helium314 branch

This file details changes made in https://github.com/mnalis/StreetComplete/tree/mnalis-v37-helium314
as modified from upstream https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete

From `mnalis-v37-helium314` branch:
* update email/github links to this repository
  so upstream is not bothered with bugs introduced here
* show ALL notes
  when `Show all notes` in preferences is enabled, really **show ALL notes**,
  including your own (only hide notes that user explicitely asked to hide,
  and which can be unhidden via `Restore hidden quests` preference)

From `upstream-helium314-new` (and `upstream-helium314-old`?) branches:
* FIXME

## TODO
* update APK build code, and put date/version/last commit in filename.
  Also, is it possible to download apk directly from actions, or must it be packed in debug.zip ?
* make `lit` quest available 24/7 again
  https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/3248#issuecomment-922493756
* Cherry-pick stuff from `helium314` branch (from https://github.com/Helium314/StreetComplete/tree/mods) (NOTE: there are probably newer version of this patches)

  Newer: https://github.com/Helium314/StreetComplete/blob/my_modifications/README.md ?

    * rename app (commit 70a2b3be92533f05beadb83e0a66b07ec6bebfde) - IIRC there is newer rename with `.h3` ?
